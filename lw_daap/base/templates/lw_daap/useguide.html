    <h1>LifeWatch Open Science Framework</h1>
    <hr/>

    <h3 id="lwframe-intro">Introduction</h3>
    <p>The LifeWatch Open Science Framework is a tool for researchers
    and general public that brings together data management features with
    a platform for analyzing those data.</p>
    <h4>Main Features</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Discover different kind of records: data management plans (DMPs),
          datasets, software, and analysis, through
          <a href="{{ url_for('search') }}">Search</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Manage the entire research life-cycle through
          <a href={{ url_for('lwdaap_projects.index') }}>Projects</a>.</li>

      <li><a href="{{ url_for('webdeposit.index') }}">Deposit</a> your own records,
          associated to projects or as independent entities.</li>

      <li>Associate a local persistent identifier (PID) to each record created
          in the framework.</li>

      <li>Mint a digital object identifier (DOI) to make records uniquely citable
          widely; record owners decide when to mint the DOI.</li>

      <li>Software and analysis records can be executed on a cloud infrastructure
          through the <a href="{{ url_for('lwdaap_analyze.index') }}">Analyze</a> tab.</li>

      <li>Records entered into this framework are stored safely in reliable disk
          systems and backed up to tape for preservation.</li>

      <li>Organize records in curated communities. By default all records nest in the
          <a href="{{ url_for('search.collection', name='community-daap') }}">{{ config.CFG_SITE_NAME }}</a>,
          you can specify any other communities during deposit. Community admins are in charge of
          accepting or rejecting the uploads according to the corresponding curation policy.
          Curated records are discoverable for the general public.</li>
   </ul>

    <h3 id="lwframe-access">User accounts</h3>
    <p>The LifeWatch Open Science Framework allows anonymous search and
       access to data of public records, other funtionality requires a valid
       user account at <a href="#">LifeWatch IdP</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="lwframe-groups">Groups</h4>
    <p><a href ="{{ url_for('mygroups') }}">Groups</a> can be used to define access groups
     to restricted records. Authenticated users can create and manage their own groups,
     send invitations and approve requests to join the groups they manage. Users
     willing to join a group will join it according to the privacy and subscription
     policy defined by the administrator of the group.</p>
    <p>Projects groups are created at the time the project is created,
       joining a project group is posible directly from the public view of the project.
    </p>

    <h3 id="lwframe-discover">Discover</h3>
    <p>Discover {{ config.CFG_SITE_NAME }} public records performing a general
    <a href="{{ url_for('search') }}">search</a> or filtering them by
    record type -DMP, Dataset, Software, Analysis- or by
    <a href="{{ url_for('communities') }}">communities</a>.</p>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>The default search mode is a search for words in any place. This means that any whitespace you type is not significant,
             but is rather interpreted to mean "add an automatic boolean AND between words".</p>

          <h4>Searching phrases</h4>
          <p>The whitespace would be significant if you include it within quotes. There are two phrase searching modes:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The double quotes instruct the search engine to search for exact phrase. This phrase search mode will match if and only if
                the given metadata field is exactly equal to the input pattern. </li>

            <li>The single quotes instruct the search engine to search for partial phrase. Unlike the exact phrase search, this mode allows
                for an extra text appearing before/after given pattern.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Boolean queries</h4>
          <p>Standard boolean operators are availables. You can also use parentheses in your queries to group boolean expressions together: </p>
          <table class="table table-condese">
          <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="col-md-2 text-center" rowspan="3" style="vertical-align: middle;">
              <strong>+<br>AND</strong>
            </td>
            <td class="col-md-3"><code>water +temperature</code></td>
            <td class="col-md-7" rowspan="3" style="vertical-align: middle;">matches all records that contain both the word
              <em>water</em> and the word <em>temperature</em>.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr><td style="border: 0px"><code>water temperature</code></td></tr>
          <tr><td style="border: 0px"><code>water and temperature</code></td></tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="text-center" rowspan="2" style="vertical-align: middle;">
              <strong>-<br>NOT</strong>
            </td>
            <td><code>water -temperature</code></td>
            <td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align: middle">
              matches all records that contain the word <em>water</em> but that do not contain the word <em>temperature</em>.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr><td style="border: 0px"><code>water not temperature</code></td></tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="text-center" rowspan="2" style="vertical-align: middle;">
              <strong>|<br>OR</strong>
            </td>
            <td><code>water | temperature</code></td>
            <td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align: middle">matches all records that contain at least one of the words.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr><td style="border: 0px;"><code>water or temperature</code></td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h4>Wildcard character</h4>
        <p>Word truncation is supported via star (*) wildcard character. The wildcard instructs the search engine to match any number
           of characters in that place.</p>

        <h4>Metadata fields</h4>
        <p>If a search term is preceded by a field name and a colon, then the term is searched for inside this field only.
           For example: <code>title: temperature</code>. Common fields you may want to use are <code>author</code>, <code>title</code>,
           <code>keyword</code>, <code>year</code>.

        <h4>Range queries</h4>
        <p>The span query is provided via a <code>-></code> sign. For example, to search for all records on temperature
           between 2013 and 2015, type:<code>temperature year:2013->2015</code>. You can also range over text fields.</p>

  <h3 id="lwframe-projects">Projects</h3>

  <p><a href={{ url_for('lwdaap_projects.index') }}>Projects</a> allow to define the complete workflow of the data life-cycle.
     Projects are searchable and any user can see public records within the projects. Authenticated users can create new
     projects or request to join an existing project. The projects accessible to the user are available at
     <a href="{{ url_for('lwdaap_projects.myprojects') }}">My Projects</a> tab of your profile. Only empty projects can be deleted.</p>

     <p>Projects define the following steps in the data life-cycle workflow:</p>
     <dl>
        <dt>Plan</dt>
        <dd>Create Data Management Plans for your data and upload the resulting document in the framework.</dd>
        <dt>Describe and collect</dt>
        <dd>Create datasets and software records to store your data and software assets.</dd>
        <dt>Curate</dt>
        <dd>Tag dataset records as curated to certify their quality.</dd>
        <dt>Integrate</dt>
        <dd>Create analysis records by combining datasets and software.</dd>
        <dt>Analyze</dt>
        <dd>Run your analysis in the cloud.</dd>
        <dt>Cite</dt>
        <dd>Mint a DOI for the selected records so they become widely citable.</dd>
        <dt>Publish</dt>
        <dd>Make records available publicly for all users of the framework.</dd>
     </dl>

    <p>Records can be created from the project by using the buttons in the different data life-cycle workflow tabs.
       All records must provide some minimal info as described in <a href="#lwframw-share">Share</a>.</p>


  <h3 id="lwframe-share">Share</h3>
    <p>Authenticated users can create new records, either inside a project or as independent entities using the
    <a href="{{ url_for('webdeposit.index') }}">Deposit</a> link:
    <ul>
    <li>A minimun amount of information is required in order to create a record:
         title, authors, description, and access rights to be granted.</li>
    <li>Additional metadata can be also specified, it is recommended to fill as
        much information as possible</li>
    <li>A minimum of one file is required for those records different to analysis records.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once the record is uploaded, it will get a persistent and unique identifier in the framework.
       Minting a DOI is also possible, the owner of the record decide when to mint the DOI
       using the button available when viewing the record details or through the <em>Cite</em>
       step of the data life-cycle in Projects.</p>

    <p>All recrods created by the user are accessible at <a href="{{ url_for('webdeposit.myuploads') }}">My Uploads</a>:<p>
    <ul>
       <li>Record metadata are always editable, but files cannot be changed once a DOI has been minted for the record.</li>
       <li>Only not finalized records can be deleted, if you want to delete an already submitted record, please contact
           <a href="mailto:{{config.CFG_SITE_SUPPORT_EMAIL}}">{{config.CFG_SITE_SUPPORT_EMAIL}}</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
      <p><strong>Discovering records</strong></p>
      <p>Records are discoverable publicly once they are curated by the communities admins in the corresponding
         communities. If the record belongs to a project first go to the <em>Publish</em> tab to make it
         available for curation. </p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="lwframe-analyze">Analyze</h3>
    <p><a href="{{ url_for('lwdaap_analyze.index') }}">Analyze</a> provides authenticated users
        with a pre-defined execution environment to use available data:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Several combinations to build the execution environments depending on the flavor, the operating system, and the application environment are available.</li>
    <li>User can click the Run button at any software and analysis records and the framework will load the
        predefined requirements (flavor, OS, environment) so user just need to confirm the selected options.</li>
    <li>A direct access to define an execution environment is available at <a href ="{{ url_for('lwdaap_analyze.launch') }}">Run an analysis</a>.</li>
    <li>The user can list, connect and terminate instances through the <a href="{{ url_for('lwdaap_analyze.index') }}">Analyze</a> view.</li>
